# Policies

Welcome to `TiN`'s policy page. 

## Usage Policy

Users must use the bot properly. It is not to be abused in any way. 
Some things we highly prohibit are admin abuse and server farming. 

## Privacy Policy

We may collect data such as guild IDs and channel IDs, however, we do not plan on using the data for anything else but storing data so it can come to terms with guilds.

Note: It is still unclear whether we will actually use any data or if we'll ever collect any.

## Misc Policy
We are allowed to have the bot leave a server if we believe that the server is abusing our policies or the platform policies. To ensure safety, we will periodically check what servers the bot is on and then come to a decision.
