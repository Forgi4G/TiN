# Policies

Welcome to `TiN`'s page of policies. 

## Usage Policy
By adding and using this bot in your server(s), you agree to follow [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and their guidelines, including conformity to `TiN`'s policies. This software is only allowed for non-malicious use. This means the software is only meant for its purposes it has demonstrated.


## Privacy Policy
The software and bot, `TiN`, does not retain or store any data at all from users or the platform. This is a strong policy against storing data and we highly believe that privacy is a valuable human right. As we assume there will be users who will depend on this software, we will not **store** any server, channel, message, user, or other data that is storable. However, the bot does collect data but does not store the data. The data that the bot collects is no control of the developers as it serves as the basis for the software to function. Data from APIs, user information such as avatars are collected in order for some commands to work, however, these are not stored in a database or any local storage. In turn, this bot does enforce privacy to the maximum. 

## Miscellaneous Policy
If we believe that there is misconduct or abuse of the bot, we will promptly remove the bot from the server(s) it is being misused in, and we reserve the right to. At any given time, the bot is allowed to leave any server at anytime if we believe necessary action needs to be taken.
